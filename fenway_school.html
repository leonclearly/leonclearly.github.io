    </header>
    <p> My dog Fenway, or "Fen" for short, is a very cute schnoodle that I got about two years ago. She is a mix of a poodle and a schnowzer, hence the breed 'shnoodle'. <p>

    <p> I am usually the first person of my family to come home, so when I came home this day, I did not receive the usual greeting from Fen. I quickly became worried for her wellbeing as I could not find her. After a little while, I spotted her on the table. </p>

  <p> As you might have guessed, Fen did not place herself in this pridicament, I did, but it was very cute so it was worth it. </p>

      <h1> Conclusion </h1>
    </header>
      <p> I hope that you learned more about my dog Fenway during your browsing of this amazingly artistic webite. But anyways, I learned a lot when making this website, beacuse I have had no prior coding expirience and this was a good first thing to make. Also, I included the least amount of words possible so that you could enjoy Fen as much as I do. </p>
