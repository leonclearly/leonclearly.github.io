    <p> My dog Fenway, or "Fen" for short, is a very cute schnoodle that I got about two years ago. She is a mix of a poodle and a schnowzer, hence the breed 'shnoodle'. <p>

    <p> As you can tell, she is a very cute dog with good fashion decisions.<p>

    <p> On a hot summer day, me and Fen went to the park for a bit, during which we played fetch. </p>

    <p> I am usually the first person of my family to come home, so when I came home this day, I did not receive the usual greeting from Fen. I quickly became worried for her wellbeing as I could not find her. After a little while, I spotted her on the table. </p>
